A simple student registration project using HTML and PHP involves creating a basic web application where students can register by providing their details such as name, age, email, and other relevant information. Here's how the project is structured and works:

1. Frontend (HTML)
Student Registration Form: The front-end part consists of an HTML form where students can input their information.
This form can include fields like:
Full Name
Age
Gender
Email Address
Phone Number
Course Selection 
The form is typically built using standard HTML tags like <form>, <input>, <select>, and <textarea>.
Validation: Basic client-side validation can be added using HTML5 attributes like required to ensure that necessary fields are filled before submission.
2. Backend (PHP)
Processing the Form: When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the server (the PHP script) using the HTTP POST method.
PHP processes the form data and may perform further validation, such as checking if the email is already registered or if the fields are correctly formatted.
Database Interaction: Once the data is validated, PHP can insert the student information into a database (e.g., MySQL).
The database would have a table (e.g., students) to store the student’s details such as name, email, phone, etc.
Feedback to User: After processing the data, PHP can display a confirmation message to the user, letting them know that their registration was successful.
Error Handling: If there are any issues (like database connection failures or invalid input), PHP will handle and display appropriate error messages.
3. Database
Database Design: The database can have a simple table for storing student records. A typical table might have columns like:
id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
name
age
email
phone
course
CRUD Operations: The PHP backend would handle Create (inserting new records), Read (viewing student data), Update (modifying data), and Delete (removing records) operations.
4. Optional Features
Data Display: A separate page could be added to display a list of registered students, showing their details from the database.
Update/Modify Information: Students could have the ability to modify their registration details if necessary.
Login and Session: Implementing a login system where students can log in using credentials before registering or viewing their information.
Email Notification: Send a confirmation email to the student after successful registration using PHP's mail() function.
Workflow:
The student opens the registration page (HTML form).
The student fills out the form and submits it.
The form data is sent to the PHP script.
PHP validates and processes the data.
The student’s data is stored in the database.
A confirmation or error message is displayed to the student.
